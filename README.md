# treaty-depth

This repository contains data and the manuscript for an in-progress manuscript on the sources of depth in alliance treaties. I argue that states use depth to manage entrapment risk while still adding credibility to their alliance obligations. To understand depth better, I compare it with unconditional military support, which tends to raise entrapment and audience costs. Because democracies have more audience cost concerns, I expect that they will design deep alliances with conditional promises of military support. A wide range of models finds consistent evidence that democracies design deeper alliances, along with mixed evidence about democracy and conditional obligations. 

The folder contains multiple scripts, which only work in the context of a project. Start with `setup-script.R` then run `alliance-democ.R`, followed by `alliance-measures.R`. These three scripts create the dataset for analysis. After this, run any of the analysis scripts as needed, but only run `plot-results.R` after running the analysis scripts.
